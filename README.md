# CH_Assessment

Welcome to the Crowe Horwath assessment! In this project you will need to the following to get this to work-

1. Run the 'CrowHorwath_assessment.sql' which is in the CH_Assessment folder.
2. Change the connection string in the CH.Core.SQLHelper class. There are two functions in there both with connection string variables. Please change the connection string to whatever yours is.

Ready to go!
